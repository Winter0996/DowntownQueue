# DowntownQueue
This project was my final project last semester in my CS2 class to conclude our review of data structures using C. I was put into a group of 3 other students and we went on campus downtown to record data of the streets we decided to include in our Queue
The overuse of comments in the project was done by one of my group members and myself included to ensure the entire group was on the same page in terms of understanding the fuctionalities of the code and the data structure being implemented
